    "michaelMichaelReview": "While an encapsulation of Arlo Parks talent and potential, Collapsed in Sunbeams suffers from too much of the same - monotony is a word that comes to mind after more than a few listens.",
    "michaelBradReview": "Excellent production does not save this album from wishing another artist was performing over the top...a Yeezus period Kanye album without Kanye.",
    "bradMichaelReview": "As an album that explores relationships and mental health, two keys theme of the current pandemic, Collapsing In Sunbeams is a nostalgic nod to the late nineties/early 2000s coffeeshop-core while still sounding fresh, forward, and soulful",
    "bradBradReview": "Building upon the success of his previous album Flower Boy, Igor is a genre-bending labor of love that helped Tyler relinquish his early role as a provecatuer and position him to deliver his most polished and honest album to date",
